This is the example code for the JavaWorld article

  "Start up the Velocity Template Engine"


HelloWorld.java
===============

This is a simple program to show the basics of rendering a
template using Velocity.

To compile, add the included velocity-dep-1.2.jar to your
classpath, and then 

  $ javac HelloWorld.java

To run the program, make sure that the template "helloworld.vm"
is in the same directory, and then

  $ java HelloWorld

and you should see the output.


PetStoreEmail.java
==================

This program is like HelloWorld, but adds different data to
the context.

You would build the same way, with the Velocity jar
in the classpath

  $ javac PetStoreEmail.java

Now, to run, there are three example tempaltes included, one
for each example given in the article -  plain text, HTML 
output, and XML output.

The corresponding templates are

   petstoreemail_plain.vm
   petstoreemail_html.vm
   petstoreemail_xml.vm

To run, choose one of the templates above and make a copy of
it named 'petstoreemail.vm'.  For example to see the HTML
output

  $ cp petstoreemail_html.vm  petstoreemail.vm

under unix (or Mac OS X :) or

  $copy petstoreemail_html.vm  petstoreemail.vm

under the Windows command prompt.

Then, you can just run the program

  $java PetStoreEmail

For fun, you might try to modify the program to take 
the template name as an argument to the program.


Sample.java
===========

To try the servlet example, I included a complete WAR
file that has been tested under Jakarta Tomcat.  It 
should work fine under most servlet containers.

The following assumes a basic understanding of Tomcat and 
a standard configuration.

To deploy under Tomcat, just drop the WAR file into the
Tomcat webapps directory, and restart Tomcat.

Then, point your browser at

  http://localhost:8080/velocity/servlet/Sample

and you should see the HTML output generated by
Velocity in your browser.
